## Extended User Model

> Intro: What we offer

An extended Django user model is a custom Django model that inherits from Django's built-in User model and adds additional fields or methods to provide more functionality or store more information about users. This is useful when you need to store additional user-specific data or implement custom user management logic beyond what the built-in User model offers.


### Reasons for extending the Django User model

Here are some common reasons for extending the Django user model:

- Store additional user data: If you need to store additional user information, such as a profile picture, date of birth, or phone number, you can add these fields to the extended user model.

- Implement custom user management logic: If you need to implement custom user management logic, such as adding custom registration or authentication workflows, you can override the methods of the built-in User model in your extended user model.

- Integrate with third-party services: If you need to integrate your Django application with third-party services, such as social login providers or payment gateways, you can add fields or methods to your extended user model to store and manage the necessary information.

- Extending the Django user model allows you to tailor the user management functionality of your application to your specific needs and requirements.

### Rocket Django User model

**Rocket Django** uses an extended user model that allows additional user information to be saved. An authenticated user can save their information and an image avatar. The extended user model is defined in the `apps/users/models.py` file. The `Profile` model in `apps/users/models.py` stores additional user information like full name, address, and avatar.

```py
# apps/users/models.py
from django.db import models
from django.contrib.auth.models import User

# Create your models here.


ROLE_CHOICES = (
    ('admin'  , 'Admin'),
    ('user'  , 'User'),
)
class Profile(models.Model):
    user      = models.OneToOneField(User, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    role      = models.CharField(max_length=20, choices=ROLE_CHOICES, default='user')
    full_name = models.CharField(max_length=255, null=True, blank=True)
    country   = models.CharField(max_length=255, null=True, blank=True)
    city      = models.CharField(max_length=255, null=True, blank=True)
    zip_code  = models.CharField(max_length=255, null=True, blank=True)
    address   = models.CharField(max_length=255, null=True, blank=True)
    phone     = models.CharField(max_length=255, null=True, blank=True)
    avatar    = models.ImageField(upload_to='avatar', null=True, blank=True)

    def __str__(self):
        return self.user.username
```

The model is implemented by creating a new model called `Profile` that holds a One-To-One relationship with the existing `User` Model through a `OneToOneField`. This allows extra information to be associated with a user. This can be customised to suit your project needs.


## Conclusion
Easily store additional user data, implement custom authentication logic, and integrate with third-party services, all while maintaining the security and reliability of Django's built-in user model. Take control of your user management and tailor it to your specific needs with Rocket Django.
